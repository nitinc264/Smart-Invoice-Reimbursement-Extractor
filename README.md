# Smart Invoice Reimbursement Extractor

An end-to-end **Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)** system that automates invoice data extraction, validation, and reimbursement logging using OCR, AI-powered refinement, and a Human-in-the-Loop verification workflow.

This project is designed to process noisy invoice PDFs and scanned images, extract structured financial data, and maintain an audit-ready Excel database for reimbursement workflows.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🔍 Dual OCR Engine Pipeline
Uses both **Tesseract OCR** and **EasyOCR** to maximize extraction accuracy across:

- Digital invoices
- Mobile-clicked scans
- Blurry receipts
- Handwritten bills
- Low-quality PDFs

The system compares outputs from both engines to improve reliability.

---

### 🤖 AI-Powered Data Refinement
Integrated with **Google Gemini Pro** for:

- OCR error correction (`O → 0`, `I → 1`, `S → 5`)
- Removing industrial OCR noise
- Cleaning inconsistent invoice formats
- Refining extracted text into structured JSON
- Resolving conflicting OCR outputs

---

### 📄 Smart Financial Field Extraction
Extracts critical invoice fields such as:

- Invoice Number
- Vendor Name
- Invoice Date
- GSTIN
- IRN
- HSN/SAC Codes
- Tax Amount
- Grand Total
- CGST / SGST / IGST
- Payment Details

Special handling is implemented for detecting **Grand Totals** hidden inside complex tax tables.

---

### 🧾 Human-in-the-Loop Verification
Provides manual verification before final submission to ensure:

- Higher extraction accuracy
- Reduced reimbursement errors
- Better audit compliance

---

### 📊 Persistent Excel Database
Validated records are automatically appended to:

```text
reimbursement_invoices.xlsx
```

Features include:

- Auto-incrementing invoice IDs
- Timestamp tracking
- Persistent storage
- Structured reimbursement records

---

### 📜 Invoice Audit Logging
Maintains a detailed:

```text
invoice_log.txt
```

Tracks:

- Upload activity
- OCR exceptions
- Processing errors
- Manual corrections
- Validation history
